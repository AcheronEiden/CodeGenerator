# PasswordGenerator

This is a password generator written in Python. When running the program, it will ask you for the wanted length of the password(s) and how many passwords you want. After answering the two questions (with just a number) you will get the desired password(s) randomized from the characters a-z , A-Z , 1-9 and the special characters !@#Â£$%&/{([])}=?.
